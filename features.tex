\begin{itemize}
\item Versatile API for new supernova light curve models, with popular models like SALT2 (and HSIAO model) implemented as examples 
\item Implemented models: SALT2, HSIAO
\item Simulation of data from light curve models
\item Faciliate exploration of supernova data
\item Multiple methods of btaining SNIa model parameters from SNIa light curves
\item Interaction with outputs of other software
\end{itemize}
